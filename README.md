## Instructions

The classic Concentration game, also known as the memory game or matching game, is easy to play and also interesting. The following are the rules to play the game:

1. The game starts when the first card is flipped.
2. Flip any 2 cards to check if they match. If they match, they stay turned facing up.
3. If there is no match, try again, while trying to keep in mind the symbols that were clicked.
4. The goal of the game is to match all the cards on the table as quickly and with as few moves as possible.
5. When all the cards are successfully matched, a popup is displayed with the match results.

My special thanks to mentor Stacy for helping me out when I was stuck on the project, she informed me that I can use Bootstrap modals for my success modal message.

A big thanks to the shuffle function and the starter code provided, the webinar by Mike. They were very helpful to help 'break the ice' and making me work confidently on the project.
